abstract: Dolutegravir (DTG), an important active pharmaceutical ingredient
  (API) used in combination therapy for the treatment of HIV, has been
  synthesized in continuous flow. By adapting the reported GlaxoSmithKline
  process chemistry batch route for Cabotegravir, DTG was produced in 4.5 h in
  sequential flow operations from commercially available mate-rials. Key
  features of the synthesis include rapid manufacturing time for pyridone
  formation, one-step direct amidation of a functionalized pyridone, and
  telescoping of multiple steps to avoid isolation of intermediates and enable
  for greater throughput

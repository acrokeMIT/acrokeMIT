This webpage is dedicated to Dr. Zhi He, a former member of the Jamison group from 2012-2015. Sadly, after beginning his independent career at Beijing Normal University, he was met with a sudden illness and passed away in October of 2016. He is remembered in the group for his kindness, humor, and determination. He will surely be missed. Our thoughts go out to all of his friends and family.

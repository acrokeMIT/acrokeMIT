title: Asymmetric Catalytic Coupling of Organoboranes, Alkynes, and Imines
  Possessing a Removable (Trialkylsilyloxy)ethyl Group - Direct Access to
  Enantiomerically Pure Primary Allylic Amines

publication: "_Angewandte Chemie 43(30), 3941-3944_, DOI: 10.1002/anie.200460044"
summary: "The aryl substituent on the catalyst is central to the success of the
  title reaction (see scheme) which affords allylic amines in up to 89 % ee and
  91 % yield with a catalyst derived from [Ni(cod)2] and a P-chiral ferrocenyl
  phosphane (e.g. 1). The coupling products are easily deprotected to
  enantiomerically enriched, tetrasubstituted primary allylic amines, which can
  be recrystallized to optical purity."

abstract: The aryl substituent on the catalyst is central to the success of the
  title reaction (see scheme) which affords allylic amines in up to 89 % ee and
  91 % yield with a catalyst derived from [Ni(cod)2] and a P-chiral ferrocenyl
  phosphane (e.g. 1). The coupling products are easily deprotected to
  enantiomerically enriched, tetrasubstituted primary allylic amines, which can
  be recrystallized to optical purity.

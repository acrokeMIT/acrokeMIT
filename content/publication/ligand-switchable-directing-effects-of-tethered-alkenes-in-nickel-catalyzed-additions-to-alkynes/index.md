summary: "Nickel-catalyzed reductive couplings of aldehydes with alkynes that
  contain tethered olefins are described, in which the degree and sense of
  regioselectivity are controlled by the length of the tether and the presence
  or absence of an additive. When the alkyne and alkene are separated by four
  bonds, very high (>95:5) regioselectivities are observed. Use of a monodentate
  phosphine as an additive leads to formation of the opposite regioisomer in
  equal and opposite selectivity (5: >95). These results provide strong evidence
  for an interaction between the remote alkene and the metal center during the
  regioselectivity-determining step and suggest that reactions with and without
  an additive proceed via fundamentally distinct mechanisms."

summary: "Many deoxynucleosides have potent effects against viruses and tumors.1
  Several have been approved as antiviral and/or anti-cancer drugs, including
  zidovudine, stavudine, trifluridine, idoxuridine, cladribine and didanosine
  (Fig. 1). Extraction from natural sources and fermentation processes provide
  only a limited number of naturally occurring 2′-deoxynucleosides; therefore,
  chemical approaches for the general synthesis of deoxynucleosides are highly
  desired.2 A common strategy is the direct SN2 reaction between a
  1-chloro-2-deoxyribose derivative and a metalated or silylated nitrogenous
  base. Drawbacks of this strategy are the costs and stereochemical lability of
  1-chloro sugars. Furthermore, the substitution reaction tends to generate a
  mixture of anomers that are difficult to separate"

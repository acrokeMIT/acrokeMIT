summary: "A convenient and efficient flow method for Ullmann condensations,
  Sonogashira couplings, and decarboxylation reactions using a commercially
  available copper tube flow reactor (CTFR) is described. The heated CTFR
  effects these transformations without added metals (e.g., Pd), ligands, or
  reagents, and in greater than 90% yield in most cases examined."

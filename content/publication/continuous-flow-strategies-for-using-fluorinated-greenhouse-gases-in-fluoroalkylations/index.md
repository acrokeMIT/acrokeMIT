abstract: Large quantities of fluorinated gases are generated as intermediates
  or byproducts from fluorinated polymer production annually, and they are
  effective ozone depleting substances or greenhouse gases. On the other hand,
  the incorporation of fluoroalkyl groups into drug molecules or bioactive
  compounds has been shown to enhance biological properties such as the
  bioavailability, binding selectivity, and metabolic stability. Extraction of
  fluoroalkyl sources, including trifluoromethyl and difluoromethyl groups, from
  the fluorinated gases is highly desirable, yet challenging under regular batch
  reaction conditions. Flow chemistry is an emerging and promising technique to
  address long-standing challenges in gasâ€“liquid batch reactions such as
  insufficient interfacial contact and scalability issues. In this review, we
  highlight recent advances in continuous flow strategies toward enabling the
  use of fluorinated greenhouse gases in organic synthesis.

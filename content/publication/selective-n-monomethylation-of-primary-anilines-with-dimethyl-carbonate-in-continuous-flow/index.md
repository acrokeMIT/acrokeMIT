abstract: Selective N-monomethylation of anilines has been achieved under
  continuous flow conditions using dimethyl carbonate as a green methylating
  agent in the presence of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene. Our methodology
  takes advantage of the expanded process windows available in the continuous
  flow regime to safely induce monomethylation in superheated solvents at high
  pressure. We propose selective N-monomethylation is achieved via an in situ
  protection-deprotection pathway, which is supported by the observed
  reactivities of several putative reaction intermediates. The robust and
  scalable method was applicable to a broad range of primary aniline substrates
  including ortho-, meta-, and para-substituted anilines, as well as
  electron-rich and electron-deficient anilines. The synthetic precursor of
  diazepam, 5-chloro-2-(methylamino)benzophenone, was selectively synthesized
  under our optimized conditions.

abstract: This tutorial review traces the development of endo-regioselective
  epoxide-opening reactions in water. Templated, water-promoted epoxide-opening
  cyclization reactions can offer rapid access to subunits of the ladder
  polyethers, a fascinating and complex family of natural products. This review
  may be of interest to those curious about the ladder polyethers and their
  hypothesized biogenesis, about organic reactions in water, and about the
  development and application of cascade reactions in organic synthesis.

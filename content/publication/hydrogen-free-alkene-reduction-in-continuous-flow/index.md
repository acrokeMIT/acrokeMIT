  reactor employed minimizes residence time by enabling safe operation at
  elevated temperature."

  The first continuous hydrogenation that requires neither H2 nor metal catalysis generates diimide by a novel reagent combination. The simple flow reactor employed minimizes residence time by enabling safe operation at elevated temperature.

summary: "Molnupiravir (MK-4482, EIDD-2801) is a promising orally bioavailable
  drug candidate for the treatment of COVID-19. Herein, we describe a
  supply-centered and chromatography-free synthesis of molnupiravir from
  cytidine, consisting of two steps: a selective enzymatic acylation followed by
  transamination to yield the final drug product. Both steps have been
  successfully performed on a decagram scale: the first step at 200 g and the
  second step at 80 g. Overall, molnupiravir has been obtained in a 41% overall
  isolated yield compared to a maximum 17% isolated yield in the patented route.
  This route provides many advantages to the initial route described in the
  patent literature and would decrease the cost of this pharmaceutical should it
  prove safe and efficacious in ongoing clinical trials."

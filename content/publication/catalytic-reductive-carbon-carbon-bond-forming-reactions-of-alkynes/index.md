summary: "Enantioselective nickel/phosphine-catalyzed reductive coupling of
  alkynes and aldehydes provides rapid access to synthetically useful allylic
  alcohols with high enantiomeric excess. A related reaction involving epoxides
  is enantiospecific, transforming alkynes and chiral terminal epoxides into
  enantiomerically pure homoallylic alcohols containing a trisubstituted olefin
  of defined geometry. A gram-scale example of each of these processes is
  described."

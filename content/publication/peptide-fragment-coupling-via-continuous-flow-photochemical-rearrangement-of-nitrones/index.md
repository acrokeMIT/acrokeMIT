summary: "Go with the flow: A general approach for amide bond formation by way
  of a continuous-flow photochemical rearrangement of nitrones was described
  (see scheme). Simple aryl-alkyl amide bonds as well as complex peptide bonds
  were constructed efficiently with a residence time less than 20 minutes. A
  tetrapeptide was synthesized in this way and the method could be applied to
  peptide fragment coupling."

  Go with the flow: A general approach for amide bond formation by way of a continuous-flow photochemical rearrangement of nitrones was described (see scheme). Simple aryl-alkyl amide bonds as well as complex peptide bonds were constructed efficiently with a residence time less than 20 minutes. A tetrapeptide was synthesized in this way and the method could be applied to peptide fragment coupling.

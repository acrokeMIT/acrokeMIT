abstract: Two nickel-catalyzed reductive coupling reactions of alkynes were
  instrumental in a modular, stereoselective synthesis of amphidinolide T1 (1).
  The C13−C21 fragment was prepared from two simple starting materials that were
  joined in a catalytic alkyne−epoxide fragment coupling operation, whereas an
  intramolecular aldehyde−alkyne reductive coupling simultaneously formed the
  final carbon−carbon bond of the macrocycle and established the C13 carbinol
  configuration with complete selectivity in the desired fashion.

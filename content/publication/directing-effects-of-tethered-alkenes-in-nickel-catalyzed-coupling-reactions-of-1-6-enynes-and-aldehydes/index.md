abstract: >
  Nickel-catalyzed reductive coupling reactions of aldehydes and 1,6-enynes
  proceed in excellent regioselectivity in the absence of a phosphine, and the
  use of a monodentate phosphine additive leads to the formation of the opposite
  regioisomer with equally high selectivity. Both products are the result of the
  same fundamental mechanism, with the inversion of regioselectivity being the
  result of stereospecific ligand substitution at the metal center.

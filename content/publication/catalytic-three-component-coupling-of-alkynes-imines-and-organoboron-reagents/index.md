abstract: An unusual degree of functional group compatibility for imine addition
  reactions was observed in the assembly of allylic amines from alkynes, imines,
  and organoboron reagents (boronic acids or boranes) by using a catalyst
  derived from [Ni(cod)2] and (c-C5H9)3Pâ€”this catalytic three-component process
  (see scheme) is tolerant of ketones, esters, and hydroxylic solvents.

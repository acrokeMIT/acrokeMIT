abstract: >
  A new route to MK-4482 was developed. The route replaces uridine with the more
  available and less expensive cytidine. Low-cost, simple reagents are used for
  the chemical transformations, and the yield is improved from 17% to 44%. A
  step is removed from the longest linear sequence, and these advancements are
  expected to expand access to MK-4482 should it become a viable drug substance.

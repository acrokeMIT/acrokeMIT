abstract: Herein we describe in full our investigations leading to the first
  total syntheses of ent-dioxepandehydrothyrsiferol and armatol A. Discovery of
  a bromonium-initiated epoxide-opening cascade enabled novel tactics for
  constructing key fragments found in both natural products and have led us to
  revise the proposed biogeneses. Other common features found in the routes
  include convergent fragment coupling strategies to assemble the natural
  products' backbones and the use of epoxide-opening cascades for rapid
  constructions of the fused polyether subunits. Through de novo synthesis of
  armatol A, we elucidate the absolute and relative configuration of this
  natural product.

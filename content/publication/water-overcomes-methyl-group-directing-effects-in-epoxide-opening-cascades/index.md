abstract: Water is an effective promoter of the endo-selective opening of
  trisubstituted epoxides, enabling related cascades leading to a variety of
  substituted ladder polyether structures. When used in conjunction with a
  tetrahydropyran-templated nucleophile, water can overcome the powerful
  electronic directing effect of a methyl substituent at either site of the
  epoxide, making water a uniquely versatile medium and promoter of epoxide
  opening.

abstract: Pumiliotoxins 209F and 251D were synthesized using highly selective
  nickel-catalyzed epoxideâˆ’alkyne reductive cyclizations as the final step. The
  exocyclic (Z)-alkene found in the majority of the pumiliotoxins was formed
  stereospecifically and regioselectively, without the use of a directing group
  on the alkyne, and the epoxide underwent ring opening exclusively at the less
  hindered carbon to provide the requisite tertiary alcohol. The epoxides were
  prepared using diastereoselective addition of a sulfoxonium anion to a
  proline-derived methyl ketone.

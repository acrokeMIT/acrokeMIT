summary: "A new photochemical flow reactor has been developed for the
  photo-induced electron-transfer deoxygenation reaction to produce 2′-deoxy and
  2′,3′-dideoxynucleosides. The continuous flow format significantly improved
  both the efficiency and selectivity of the reaction, with the streamlined
  multi-step sequence directly furnishing the highly desired unprotected
  deoxynucleosides."

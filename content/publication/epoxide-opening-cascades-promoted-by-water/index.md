abstract: "Selectivity rules in organic chemistry have been inferred largely
  from nonaqueous environments. In contrast, enzymes operate in water, and the
  chemical effect of the medium change remains only partially understood.
  Structural characterization of the “ladder” polyether marine natural products
  raised a puzzle that persisted for 20 years: Although the stereochemistry of
  adjacent tetrahydropyran (THP) cycles would seem to arise from a biosynthetic
  cascade of epoxide-opening reactions, experience in organic solvents argued
  consistently that such a pathway would be kinetically disfavored. We report
  that neutral water acts as an optimal promoter for the requisite ring-opening
  selectivity, once a single templating THP is appended to a chain of epoxides.
  This strategy offers a high-yielding route to the naturally occurring ladder
  core and highlights the likely importance of aqueous-medium effects in
  underpinning certain noteworthy enzymatic selectivities."

abstract: The preparation of CpRu(MeCN)3PF6 using an easily assembled continuous
  flow reactor is described. This scalable, reproducible method provides the
  title compound in excellent yield and purity, and eliminates the need for any
  purification steps. Under our optimized conditions, the residence time
  required for complete conversion was only 5 min at an initial substrate
  concentration of 0.06 M, as compared to a reaction time of 12–36 h for the
  batch process at 0.02 M. This threefold increase in concentration and
  significant decrease in reaction time increases the throughput and efficiency
  of the synthesis. Using the simple laboratory equipment described herein,
  ruthenium catalyst of >99% purity was produced with a throughput of 1.56 g/h
  (5 mL reactor), which is 10 times the highest reported throughput for the
  batch process

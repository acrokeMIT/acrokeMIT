abstract: By simple combination of water and sodium iodide (NaI) with
  chlorotrimethylsilane (TMSCl), promotion of a Vorbrüggen glycosylation en
  route to essential HIV drugs emtricitabine (FTC) and lamivudine (3TC) is
  achieved. TMSCl–NaI in wet solvent (0.1 M water) activates a 1,3-oxathiolanyl
  acetate donor for N-glycosylation of silylated cytosine derivatives, leading
  to cis-oxathiolane products with up to 95% yield and >20:1 dr. This telescoped
  sequence is followed by recrystallization and borohydride reduction, resulting
  in rapid synthesis of (±)-FTC/3TC from a tartrate diester.

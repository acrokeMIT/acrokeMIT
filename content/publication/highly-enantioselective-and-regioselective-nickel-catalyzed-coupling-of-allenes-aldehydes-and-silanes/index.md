summary: "A complex derived from Ni(cod)2 and NHC−IPr catalyzes a
  three-component coupling reaction involving allenes, aldehydes, and
  organosilanes and transfers the axial chirality of the allene to a stereogenic
  center in the product with very high fidelity. An unexpected regioselectivity
  is observed; favored are allylic rather than homoallylic alcohol derivatives,
  corresponding to the unusual process of coupling two electrophilic atoms:  the
  allene sp and aldehyde carbon atoms. In all cases, high enantioselectivity,
  high Z/E selectivity, and, with differentially substituted allenes, high site
  selectivity are observed. This transformation represents the first
  enantioselective multicomponent coupling process of allenes."

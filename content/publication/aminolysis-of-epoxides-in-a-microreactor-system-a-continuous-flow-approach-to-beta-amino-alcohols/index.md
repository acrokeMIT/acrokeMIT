abstract: The use of a continuous flow microreactor for Î²-amino alcohol
  formation by epoxide aminolysis is evaluated. Comparison to microwave batch
  reactions reveals that conditions obtainable in the microreactor can match or
  improve yields in many cases. By increasing the pressure of the system,
  maximum temperatures can also exceed those accessible using a microwave unit.
  The use of a microreactor for epoxide aminolysis reactions in the synthesis of
  two pharmaceutical relevant compounds is described.

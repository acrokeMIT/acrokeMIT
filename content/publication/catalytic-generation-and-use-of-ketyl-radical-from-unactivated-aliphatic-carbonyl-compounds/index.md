abstract: Generation of a ketyl radical from unactivated aliphatic carbonyl
  compounds is an important strategy in organic synthesis. Herein, catalytic
  generation and use of a ketyl radical for the reductive coupling of aliphatic
  carbonyl compounds and styrenes by organic photoredox catalysis is described.
  The method is applicable to both aliphatic ketones and aldehydes to afford the
  corresponding tertiary and secondary alcohols in continuous flow and batch.
  Preliminary mechanistic investigation suggests the catalytic formation of a
  ketyl radical intermediate

summary: "In the presence of a silyl triflate and an amine base, a
  nickel–phosphine complex catalyzes the direct conjugate addition of ethylene,
  α-olefins, and aryl alkenes to unsaturated aldehydes and ketones. The
  enolsilane products are isolated in good to very high yield, and in very high
  stereoselectivity for some cases. The alkene is a functional equivalent of an
  alkenylmetal reagent in the transformation."

abstract: Redox species have been explored extensively for catalysis, energy
  storage, and molecular recognition. It is shown that nanostructured
  pseudocapacitive electrodes functionalized with ferrocene-based redox polymers
  are an attractive platform for the selective sorptive separation of dilute
  organic anions from strong aqueous and organic electrolyte solutions, and
  subsequent release of the sorbed ions to a stripping phase through
  electrochemical control of the specific binding processes. A remarkable degree
  of selectivity is shown for carboxylates (–COO–), sulfonates (–SO3−), and
  phosphonates (–PO3−2) over inorganic anions such as PF6− and ClO4− (separation
  factor >140 in aqueous and >3000 in organic systems), and between carboxylates
  with various substituents, based on differences in electronic structure and
  density of the adsorbates, beyond size, and charge. Our organometallic redox
  electrodes are a promising platform for targeting aqueous and organic systems
  requiring high separation factors and fast throughput, such as in the recovery
  of value-added products from organic synthesis and isolation of dilute yet
  highly toxic organic contaminants. The combination of spectroscopic
  experiments and quantum chemistry sheds light on a selective binding mechanism
  based on redox-enhanced hydrogen bonding between the cyclopentadienyl ligand
  and the carboxylate functional group, with broader implications for molecular
  design, supramolecular recognition, and metallocene catalysis.

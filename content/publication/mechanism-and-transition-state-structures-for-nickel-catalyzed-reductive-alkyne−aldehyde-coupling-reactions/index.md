abstract: The mechanism of nickel-catalyzed reductive alkyne−aldehyde coupling
  reactions has been investigated using density functional theory. The preferred
  mechanism involves oxidative cyclization to form the nickeladihydrofuran
  intermediate followed by transmetalation and reductive elimination. The rate-
  and selectivity-determining oxidative cyclization transition state is analyzed
  in detail. The d → π*⊥ back-donation stabilizes the transition state and leads
  to higher reactivity for alkynes than alkenes. Strong Lewis acids accelerate
  the couplings with both alkynes and alkenes by coordinating with the aldehyde
  oxygen in the transition state.

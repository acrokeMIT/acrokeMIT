abstract: In a total residence time of three minutes, ibuprofen was assembled
  from its elementary building blocks with an average yield of above 90 % for
  each step. A scale-up of this five-stage process (3 bond-forming steps, one
  work-up, and one in-line liquid–liquid separation) provided ibuprofen at a
  rate of 8.09 g h−1 (equivalent to 70.8 kg y−1) using a system with an overall
  footprint of half the size of a standard laboratory fume hood. Aside from the
  high throughput, several other aspects of this synthesis expand the
  capabilities of continuous-flow processing, including a Friedel–Crafts
  acylation run under neat conditions and promoted by AlCl3, an exothermic
  in-line quench of high concentrations of precipitation-prone AlCl3,
  liquid–liquid separations run at or above 200 psi to provide solvent-free
  product, and the use of highly aggressive oxidants, such as iodine
  monochloride. The use of simple, inexpensive, and readily available reagents
  thus affords a practical synthesis of this important generic pharmaceutical.

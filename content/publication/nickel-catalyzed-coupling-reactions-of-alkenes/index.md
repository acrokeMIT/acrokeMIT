abstract: Several reactions of simple, unactivated alkenes with electrophiles
  under nickel(0) catalysis are discussed. The coupling of olefins with
  aldehydes and silyl triflates provides allylic or homoallylic alcohol
  derivatives, depending on the supporting ligands and, to a lesser extent, the
  substrates employed. Reaction of alkenes with isocyanates yields N-alkyl
  acrylamides. In these methods, alkenes act as the functional equivalents of
  alkenyl- and allylmetal reagents.

abstract: (−)-Terpestacin (1, naturally occurring enantiomer) and
  (+)-11-epi-terpestacin (2) were prepared using catalyst-controlled,
  stereoselective, intermolecular reductive coupling reactions of alkyne 9 and
  aldehyde 10, affording allylic alcohols 42 or 11-epi-42 in a 3:1 ratio (or 1:3
  depending on the enantiomer of ligand 41a used). These stereoselective
  fragment couplings were instrumental in confirming that “siccanol” is not
  11-epi-terpestacin but, in fact, is (−)-terpestacin itself. Several
  intramolecular alkyne−aldehyde reductive coupling approaches to 1 and 2 were
  also investigated and are discussed herein.

summary: "Ringing the changes: The total synthesis of the title compound
  centers around a novel strategy that employs a nickel(0)–phosphine complex and
  triethyl borane in an efficient closure of a 14-membered ring through CC bond
  formation (see scheme; cod=cyclooctadiene). The synthesis was accomplished in
  10 steps and in approximately 9 % overall yield."

summary: "Continuous flow chemistry is being used increasingly; however, without
  detailed knowledge of reaction engineering, it can be difficult to judge
  whether dispersion and mixing are important factors on reaction outcome.
  Understanding these effects can result in improved choices of reactor
  dimensions and give insight for reactor scale-up. We provide an overview of
  both dispersive and mixing effects in flow systems and present simple
  relationships for determining whether mixing or dispersion is important for a
  given flow system. These results are summarized in convenient charts to enable
  the experimentalist to identify conditions with potential mixing or dispersion
  problems. The information also expedites design changes, such as inclusion or
  changes of mixers and changes in reaction tube diameters. As a case study,
  application of the principles to a glycosylation reaction results in increased
  throughput and cleaner product profiles compared to previously reported
  results."

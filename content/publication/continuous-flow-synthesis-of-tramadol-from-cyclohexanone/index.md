summary: "A multioperation, continuous-flow platform for the synthesis of
  tramadol, ranging from gram to decagram quantities, is described. The platform
  is segmented into two halves allowing for a single operator to modulate
  between preparation of the intermediate by Mannich addition or complete the
  fully concatenated synthesis. All purification operations are incorporated
  in-line for the Mannich reaction. ‘Flash’ reactivity between
  meta-methoxyphenyl magnesium bromide and the Mannich product was controlled
  with a static helical mixer and tested with a combination of flow and
  batch-based and factorial evaluations. These efforts culminated in a rapid
  production rate of tramadol (13.7 g°h–1) sustained over 56 reactor volumes. A
  comparison of process metrics including E-Factor, production rate, and
  space-time yield are used to contextualize the developed platform with respect
  to established engineering and synthetic methods for making tramadol."

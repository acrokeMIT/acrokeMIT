summary: "The structural features of polycyclic polyether natural products can, in some
  cases, be traced to their biosynthetic origin. However in case that are less
  well understood, only biosynthetic pathways that feature dramatic, yet
  speculative, epoxide-opening cascades are proposed. We summarize how such
  epoxide-opening cascade reactions have been used in the synthesis of
  polycyclic polyethers (see scheme) and related natural products."

  The structural features of polycyclic polyether natural products can, in some cases, be traced to their biosynthetic origin. However in case that are less well understood, only biosynthetic pathways that feature dramatic, yet speculative, epoxide-opening cascades are proposed. We summarize how such epoxide-opening cascade reactions have been used in the synthesis of polycyclic polyethers (see scheme) and related natural products.

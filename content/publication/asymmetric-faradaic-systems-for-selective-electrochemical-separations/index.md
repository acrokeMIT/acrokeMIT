  Ion-selective electrochemical systems are promising for liquid phase
  separations, particularly for water

  purification and environmental remediation, as well as in chemical production operations. Redoxmaterials offer an attractive platform for these separations based on their remarkable ion selectivity.

  Water splitting, a primary parasitic reaction in aqueous-phase processes, severely limits the performance of

  such electrochemical processes through significant lowering of current efficiencies and harmful changes in

  water chemistry. We demonstrate that an asymmetric Faradaic cell with redox-functionalization of both

  the cathode and the anode can suppress water reduction and enhance ion separation, especially

  targeting organic micropollutants with current efficiencies of up to 96% towards selective ion-binding.

  A number of organometallic redox-cathodes with electron-transfer properties matching those of a

  ferrocene-functionalized anode, and with potential cation selectivity, were used in the asymmetric cell,

  with cobalt polymers being particularly effective towards aromatic cation adsorption. We demonstrate

  the viability and superior performance of dual-functionalized asymmetric electrochemical cells beyond

  their use in energy storage systems; they can be considered as a next-generation technology for

  aqueous-phase separations, and we anticipate their broad applicability in other processes, including

  electrocatalysis and sensing

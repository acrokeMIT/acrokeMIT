abstract: This report describes a number of new synthetic approaches toward
  methyl-substituted mono- and diepoxy alcohols that serve as substrates for
  endo-selective epoxide-opening cascades. The key transformations involve the
  manipulation of alkynes. Highlighted are the directed methylmetalation of
  bishomopropargylic alcohols, the bromoallylation of alkynes, and Pd-catalyzed
  cross-coupling between an alkenyl boronate ester and allylic bromides.

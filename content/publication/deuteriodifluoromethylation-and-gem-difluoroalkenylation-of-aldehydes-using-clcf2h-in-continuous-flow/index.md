summary: "The deuteriodifluoromethyl group (CF2D) represents a challenging
  functional group due to difficult deuterium incorporation and unavailability
  of precursor reagents. Herein, we report the use of chlorodifluoromethane
  (ClCF2H) gas in the continuous flow deuteriodifluoromethylation and
  gem-difluoroalkenylation of aldehydes. Mechanistic studies revealed that the
  difluorinated oxaphosphetane (OPA) intermediate can proceed via alkaline
  hydrolysis in the presence of D2O to provide α-deuteriodifluoromethylated
  benzyl alcohols or undergo a retro [2+2] cycloaddition under thermal
  conditions to provide the gem-difluoroalkenylated product."

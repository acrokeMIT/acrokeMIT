abstract: A strategy for the continuous flow synthesis of angiotensin converting
  enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is described. An optimization effort guided by in situ
  IR analysis resulted in a general amide coupling approach facilitated by
  N-carboxyanhydride (NCA) activation that was further characterized by reaction
  kinetics analysis in batch. The three-step continuous process was demonstrated
  by synthesizing 8 different ACE inhibitors in up to 88 % yield with
  throughputs in the range of ≈0.5 g h−1, all while avoiding both isolation of
  reactive intermediates and process intensive reaction conditions. The process
  was further developed by preparing enalapril, a World Health Organization
  (WHO) essential medicine, in an industrially relevant flow platform that
  scaled throughput to ≈1 g h−1.

abstract: The application of stereochemically defined acyclic fully substituted
  enolates of ketones to the enantioselective synthesis of quaternary carbon
  stereocenters would be highly valuable. Herein, we describe an approach
  leading to the formation of several new stereogenic centers through a combined
  metalation–addition of a carbonyl–carbamoyl transfer to reveal in situ
  stereodefined α,α-disubstituted enolates of ketone as a single stereoisomer.
  This approach could produce a series of aldol and Mannich products from enol
  carbamate with excellent diastereomeric ratios.

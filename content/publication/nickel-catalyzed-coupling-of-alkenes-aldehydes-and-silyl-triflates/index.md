abstract: A full account of two recently developed nickel-catalyzed coupling
  reactions of alkenes, aldehydes, and silyl triflates is presented. These
  reactions provide either allylic alcohol or homoallylic alcohol derivatives
  selectively, depending on the ligand employed. These processes are believed to
  be mechanistically distinct from Lewis acid-catalyzed carbonyl-ene reactions,
  and several lines of evidence supporting this hypothesis are discussed.

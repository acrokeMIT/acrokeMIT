abstract: Tremendous advances have been made in nickel catalysis over the past
  decade. Several key properties of nickel, such as facile oxidative addition
  and ready access to multiple oxidation states, have allowed the development of
  a broad range of innovative reactions. In recent years, these properties have
  been increasingly understood and used to perform transformations long
  considered exceptionally challenging. Here we discuss some of the most recent
  and significant developments in homogeneous nickel catalysis, with an emphasis
  on both synthetic outcome and mechanism.

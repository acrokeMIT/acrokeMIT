abstract: Shortly after the initial isolation of marine ladder polyether natural
  products, biomimetic epoxide-opening cascade reactions were proposed as an
  efficient strategy for the synthesis of these compounds. However, difficulties
  in assembling the cascade precursors have limited the realization of these
  cascades. In this report, we describe strategies that provide convergent
  access to cascade precursors via regioselective allylation and efficient
  fragment coupling. We then investigate epoxide-opening cascades promoted by
  strong bases for the formation of fused tetrahydropyrans. These strategies are
  evaluated in the context of the synthesis of rings CDEFG of brevisulcenal F.

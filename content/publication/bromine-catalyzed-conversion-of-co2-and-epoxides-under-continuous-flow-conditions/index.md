summary: "A continuous method for the formation of cyclic carbonates from epoxides andcarbon dioxide (CO2) isdescribed. The catalysts used are inexpensive and effective in converting the reagents to the products in a residence time (tR) of 30 min. The cyclic carbonate products are obtained in good to excellent yield (51−92%). On the basis of a series of kinetics experiments, we propose a reaction mechanism involving epoxide activation by electrophilic bromine and CO2 activation by an amide."

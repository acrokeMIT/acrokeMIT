abstract: A Ni-catalyzed reductive coupling of alkynes and epoxides using Ni(II)
  salts and simple alcohol reducing agents is described. Whereas previously
  reported conditions relied on Ni(cod)2 and Et3B, this system has several
  advantages including the use of air-stable and inexpensive Ni(II) precatalysts
  (e.g., NiBr2·3H2O) as the source of Ni(0) and simple alcohols (e.g.,
  2-propanol) as the reducing agent. Deuterium-labeling experiments are
  consistent with oxidative addition of an epoxide C–O bond that occurs with
  inversion of configuration.

summary: "The ability to synthesize complex organic molecules is essential to
  the discovery and manufacture of functional compounds, including
  small-molecule medicines. Despite advances in laboratory automation, the
  identification and development of synthetic routes remain a manual process and
  experimental synthesis platforms must be manually configured to suit the type
  of chemistry to be performed, requiring time and effort investment from expert
  chemists. The ideal automated synthesis platform would be capable of planning
  its own synthetic routes and executing them under conditions that facilitate
  scale-up to production goals. Individual elements of the chemical development
  process (design, route development, experimental configuration, and execution)
  have been streamlined in previous studies, but none has presented a path
  toward integration of computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP), expert refined
  chemical recipe generation, and robotically executed chemical synthesis."

summary: "Synthesis of the fused polycyclic ether motif comprising the EFG rings of the marine ladder polyethers tamulamides A and B has been achieved via two different etherification strategies. Ultimately, a reductive etherification approach proved most successful due to tolerance of the G ring substitution and provided the EFG 6,7,6 ring system in 58% yield."

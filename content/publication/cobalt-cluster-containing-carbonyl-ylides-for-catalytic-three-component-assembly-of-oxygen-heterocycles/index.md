abstract: A dicobalt hexacarbonyl (Co2(CO)6) cluster is essential for the
  unusually broad dipolarophile scope and for the sense and degree of
  diastereoselection in a catalytic, three-component synthesis of
  tetrahydrofurans and dihydrofurans. Likely involving a new class of carbonyl
  ylide, these cycloadditions are stereospecific with respect to the
  dipolarophile and exhibit high diastereoselectivity and regioselectivity in
  most cases. Differentiation of all four positions of the tetrahydrofuran can
  thus be accomplished in a triply convergent manner.

abstract: Synthesis of the fused tetrahydrofuran motif comprising the ABC rings
  of the marine ladder polyethers tamulamides A and B has been achieved via two
  different polyepoxide cascade strategies. Investigations into a triepoxide
  cascade under aqueous conditions revealed the importance of the electronic
  nature of the cascade end-group with this initial approach. Ultimately, a
  diepoxide cascade under basic conditions proved most successful, providing the
  ABC tetrahydropyran triad in 41% yield.

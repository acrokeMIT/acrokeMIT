summary: "Synthesis of the fused tetrahydrofuran motif comprising the ABC rings of the marine ladder polyethers tamulamides A and B has been achieved via two different polyepoxide cascade strategies. Investigations into a triepoxide cascade under aqueous conditions revealed the importance of the electronic nature of the cascade end-group with this initial approach. Ultimately, a diepoxide cascade under basic conditions proved most successful, providing the ABC tetrahydropyran triad in 41% yield."

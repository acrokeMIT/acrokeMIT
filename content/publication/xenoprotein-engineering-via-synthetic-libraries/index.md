abstract: Chemical methods have enabled the total synthesis of protein molecules
  of ever-increasing size and complexity. However, methods to engineer synthetic
  proteins comprising noncanonical amino acids have not kept pace, even though
  this capability would be a distinct advantage of the total synthesis approach
  to protein science. In this work, we report a platform for protein engineering
  based on the screening of synthetic one-bead one-compound protein libraries.
  Screening throughput approaching that of cell surface display was achieved by
  a combination of magnetic bead enrichment, flow cytometry analysis of on-bead
  screens, and high-throughput MS/MS-based sequencing of identified active
  compounds. Direct screening of a synthetic protein library by these methods
  resulted in the de novo discovery of mirror-image miniprotein-based binders to
  a âˆ¼150-kDa protein target, a task that would be difficult or impossible by
  other means.

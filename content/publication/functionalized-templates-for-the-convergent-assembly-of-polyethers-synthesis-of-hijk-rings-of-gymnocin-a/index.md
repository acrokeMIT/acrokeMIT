summary: "Extension ladder: The successful application of epoxide-opening
  strategies towards the synthesis of ladder-type polyethers is contingent upon
  further elaboration of the product. By employing two different functionalized
  templates, a fragment of gymnocin A that bears four sites for subsequent
  fragment coupling has been prepared (see scheme; Bn=benzyl)."

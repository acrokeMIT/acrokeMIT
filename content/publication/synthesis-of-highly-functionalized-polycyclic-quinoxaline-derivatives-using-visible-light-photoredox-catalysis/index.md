summary: "A mild and facile method for preparing highly functionalized pyrrolo[1,2-a]quinoxalines and other nitrogen-rich heterocycles, each containing a quinoxaline core or an analogue thereof, has been developed. The novel method features a visible-light-induced decarboxylative radical coupling of ortho-substituted arylisocyanides and radicals generated from phenyliodine(III) dicarboxylate reagents and exhibits excellent functional group compatibility. A wide range of quinoxaline heterocycles have been prepared. Finally, a telescoped preparation of these polycyclic compounds by integration of the in-line isocyanide formation and photochemical cyclization has been established in a three-step continuous-flow system."

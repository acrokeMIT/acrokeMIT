abstract: The origins of reactivity and regioselectivity in nickel-catalyzed
  reductive coupling reactions of alkynes and aldehydes were investigated with
  density functional calculations. The regioselectivities of reactions of simple
  alkynes are controlled by steric effects, while conjugated enynes and diynes
  are predicted to have increased reactivity and very high regioselectivities,
  placing alkenyl or alkynyl groups distal to the forming C−C bond. The
  reactions of enynes and diynes involve 1,4-attack of the Ni−carbonyl complex
  on the conjugated enyne or diyne. The consequences of these conclusions on
  reaction design are discussed.

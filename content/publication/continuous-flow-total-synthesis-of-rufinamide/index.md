summary: "Small molecules bearing 1,2,3-triazole functionalities are important intermediates and pharmaceuticals. Common methods to access the triazole moiety generally require the generation and isolation of organic azide intermediates. Continuous flow synthesis provides the opportunity to synthesize and consume the energetic organoazides, without accumulation thereof. In this report, we described a continuous synthesis of the antiseizure medication rufinamide. This route is convergent and features copper tubing reactor-catalyzed cycloaddition reaction. Each of the three chemical steps enjoys significant benefits and has several advantages by being conducted in flow. The total average residence time of the synthesis is approximately 11 min, and rufinamide is obtained in 92% overall yield"

abstract: The development of a nickel-catalyzed coupling of terminal allenes,
  aldehydes, and silanes is described. This transformation selectively provides
  1,1-disubstituted allylic alcohols, protected as a silyl ether. The choice of
  the reducing agent is essential for achieving selectivity in this coupling
  process. A trialkylphosphine (Cyp3P) and an N-heterocyclic carbene (IPr) are
  complementary in this reaction.

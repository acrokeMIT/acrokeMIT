summary: "The development of a nickel-catalyzed coupling of terminal allenes, aldehydes, and silanes is described. This transformation selectively provides 1,1-disubstituted allylic alcohols, protected as a silyl ether. The choice of the reducing agent is essential for achieving selectivity in this coupling process. A trialkylphosphine (Cyp3P) and an N-heterocyclic carbene (IPr) are complementary in this reaction."

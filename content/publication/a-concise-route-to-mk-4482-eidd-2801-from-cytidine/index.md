abstract: >-
  A two-step route to MK-4482 (EIDD-2801, 1) was developed

  consisting of an esterification and hydroxamination of cytidine.

  The selective acylation and direct amination eliminate the need

  for protecting and activating groups and proceed in overall yield of

  75%, a significant advancement over the reported yield of 17%. The

  step count is reduced from five transformations to two, and expensive uridine is replaced with the more available cytidine.

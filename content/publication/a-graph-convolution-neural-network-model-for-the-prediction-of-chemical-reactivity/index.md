abstract: "We present a supervised learning approach to predict the products of
  organic reactions given their reactants, reagents, and solvent(s). The
  prediction task is factored into two stages comparable to manual expert
  approaches: considering possible sites of reactivity and evaluating their
  relative likelihoods. By training on hundreds of thousands of reaction
  precedents covering a broad range of reaction types from the patent
  literature, the neural model makes informed predictions of chemical
  reactivity. The model predicts the major product correctly over 85% of the
  time requiring around 100 ms per example, a significantly higher accuracy than
  achieved by previous machine learning approaches, and performs on par with
  expert chemists with years of formal training. We gain additional insight into
  predictions via the design of the neural model, revealing an understanding of
  chemistry qualitatively consistent with manual approaches."

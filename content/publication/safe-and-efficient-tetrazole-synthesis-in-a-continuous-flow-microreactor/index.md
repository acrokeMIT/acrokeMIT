abstract: "Safer flow: The synthesis of 5-substituted tetrazoles in flow (see
  scheme) is safe, efficient, scalable, requires no metal promoter, and uses a
  near-equimolar amount of NaN3, yet nonetheless displays a broad substrate
  scope. The hazards associated with HN3 are essentially eliminated,
  shock-sensitive metal azides such as Zn(N3)2 are avoided, and residual NaN3 is
  quenched in-line with NaNO2."

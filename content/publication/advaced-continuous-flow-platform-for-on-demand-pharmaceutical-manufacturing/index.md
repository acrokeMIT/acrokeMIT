abstract: As a demonstration of an alternative to the challenges faced with
  batch pharmaceutical manufacturing including the large production footprint
  and lengthy time-scale, we previously reported a refrigerator-sized continuous
  flow system for the on-demand production of essential medicines. Building on
  this technology, herein we report a second-generation, reconfigurable and 25 %
  smaller (by volume) continuous flow pharmaceutical manufacturing platform
  featuring advances in reaction and purification equipment. Consisting of two
  compact [0.7 (L)×0.5 (D)×1.3 m (H)] stand-alone units for synthesis and
  purification/formulation processes, the capabilities of this automated system
  are demonstrated with the synthesis of nicardipine hydrochloride and the
  production of concentrated liquid doses of ciprofloxacin hydrochloride,
  neostigmine methylsulfate and rufinamide that meet US Pharmacopeia standards.

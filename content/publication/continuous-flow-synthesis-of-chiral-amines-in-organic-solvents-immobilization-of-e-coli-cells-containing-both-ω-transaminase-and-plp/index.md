summary: "E. coli cells containing overexpressed (R)-selective ω-transaminase
  and the cofactor PLP were immobilized on methacrylate beads suitable for
  continuous flow applications. The use of an organic solvent suppresses
  leaching of PLP from the cells; no additional cofactor was required after
  setting up the packed-bed reactor containing the biocatalyst (ω-TA-PLP).
  Non-natural ketone substrates were transformed in flow with excellent
  enantioselectivity (>99%ee). Features of this novel system include
  high-throughput (30−60 min residence time), clean production (no quench,
  workup, or purification required), high enzyme stability (the packedbed
  reactor can be continuously operated for 1−10 days), and excellent mass
  recovery."

abstract: Achieving high selectivity in the Heck reaction of electronically
  unbiased alkenes has been a longstanding challenge. Using a nickel-catalyzed
  cationic Heck reaction, we were able to achieve excellent selectivity for
  branched products (19:1 in all cases) over a wide range of aryl electrophiles
  and aliphatic olefins. A bidentate ligand with a suitable bite angle and
  steric profile was key to obtaining high branched/linear selectivity, whereas
  the appropriate base suppressed alkene isomerization of the product. Although
  aryl triflates are traditionally used to access the cationic Heck pathway, we
  have shown that, by using triethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate, we can
  effect a counterion exchange of the catalytic nickel complex, such that
  cheaper and more stable aryl chlorides, mesylates, tosylates, and sulfamates
  can be used to yield the same branched products with high selectivity

  A new and highly selective method for the synthesis of hydroxyl-substituted
  tetrahydropyrans is described. This method utilizes titanium(IV) isopropoxide
  and diethyl tartrate to perform a diastereoselective epoxidation

  followed by in situ epoxide activation and highly selective endocyclization to form the desired tetrahydropyran ring. The HIJ ring fragment of the marine ladder polyether yessotoxin was synthesized using this two-stage tactic that proceeds with high efficiency and excellent regioselectivity

abstract: Flow chemistry has attracted significant interest in pharmaceutical
  development, where substantial efforts have been directed toward the design of
  continuous processes. Here, we report a total synthesis of atropine in flow
  that features an unusual hydroxymethylation and separation of several
  byproducts with high structural similarity to atropine. Using a combination of
  careful pH control in three sequential liquidâ€“liquid extractions and a
  functionalized resin, atropine is delivered by the flow system with>98% purity

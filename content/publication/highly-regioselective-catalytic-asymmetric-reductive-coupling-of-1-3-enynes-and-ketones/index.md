abstract: Highly regioselective, catalytic asymmetric reductive coupling
  reactions of 1,3-enynes and ketones have been achieved using catalytic amounts
  of Ni(cod)2 and a P-chiral, monodentate ferrocenyl phosphine ligand. These
  couplings represent the first examples of catalytic, intermolecular reductive
  coupling of alkynes and ketones, enantioselective or otherwise, and afford
  synthetically useful 1,3-dienes possessing a quaternary carbinol stereogenic
  center in up to 70% ee.

abstract: >-
  Described herein is a novel Lewis acid catalyzed rearrangementâˆ’coupling of
  oxygen heterocycles and bis (diethylamino)chlorophosphine that provides direct
  formation of the phosphonomethyl ether functionality found in several
  important antiretroviral agents. A wide range of dioxolanes and 1,3-dioxanes
  may be employed, furnishing the desired products in good yield. The utility of
  this method is demonstrated in a

  novel synthesis of tenofovir, an antiretroviral drug used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS and hepatitis B.

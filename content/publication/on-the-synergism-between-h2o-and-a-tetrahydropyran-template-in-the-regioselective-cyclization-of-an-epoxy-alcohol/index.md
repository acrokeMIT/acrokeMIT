abstract: A regioselective epoxy alcohol cyclization promoted by the combination
  of neutral water and a tetrahydropyran template was investigated through a
  series of mechanistic experiments carried out on an epoxy alcohol containing a
  tetrahydropyran ring (1a) and its carbocyclic congener (1b). In contrast to
  1a, cyclizations of 1b were unselective and displayed significantly faster
  reaction rates suggesting that the tetrahydropyran oxygen in 1a is requisite
  for regioselective cyclization. Reactions for both substrates were shown to
  occur in solution and under kinetic control without significant influence from
  hydrophobic effects. Kinetic measurements carried out in water/dimethyl
  sulfoxide mixtures suggest that 1b reacts exclusively through an unselective
  pathway requiring one water molecule more than what is required to solvate the
  epoxy alcohol. Similar experiments for 1a suggest a competition between an
  unselective and a selective pathway requiring one and two water molecules in
  excess of those required to solvate 1a, respectively. The selective pathway
  observed for 1a but not in 1b is rationalized by electronic and conformational
  differences between the two compounds.

abstract: Herein, the blockbuster antibacterial drug linezolid is synthesized
  from simple starting blocks by a convergent continuous flow sequence involving
  seven (7) chemical transformations. This is the highest total number of
  distinct reaction steps ever performed in continuous flow without conducting
  solvent exchanges or intermediate purification. Linezolid was obtained in 73 %
  isolated yield in a total residence time of 27 minutes, corresponding to a
  throughput of 816 mg h−1.

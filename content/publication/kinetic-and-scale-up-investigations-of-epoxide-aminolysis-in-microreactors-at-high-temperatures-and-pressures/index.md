abstract: A continuous-flow microreactor is applied for a kinetic study of a
  model Î²-amino alcohol formation by epoxide aminolysis. A large number of
  experiments are performed in a short time with minimal reagent consumption.
  The kinetics of formation of secondary aminolysis between starting epoxide and
  product are decoupled from the primary synthesis, constructing a complete
  model for desired product formation. The activation energy for the formation
  of desired product is observed to be higher than those for regioisomer
  formation and for secondary aminolysis, indicating that increasing temperature
  improves selectivity in addition to accelerating the reaction. A set of
  optimized conditions is then selected for best reaction performance, and the
  process is scaled up to a 100-fold larger reactor volume with model
  predictions in good agreement with measured process performance.

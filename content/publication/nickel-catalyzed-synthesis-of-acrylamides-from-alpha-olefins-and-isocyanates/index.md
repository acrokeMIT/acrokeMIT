abstract: The nickel(0)-catalyzed coupling of α-olefins and isocyanates proceeds
  in the presence of the N-heterocyclic carbene ligand IPr to provide
  α,β-unsaturated amides. Carbon−carbon bond formation occurs preferentially at
  the 2-position of the olefin. The N-tert-butyl amide products can be converted
  to the corresponding primary amides under acidic conditions.

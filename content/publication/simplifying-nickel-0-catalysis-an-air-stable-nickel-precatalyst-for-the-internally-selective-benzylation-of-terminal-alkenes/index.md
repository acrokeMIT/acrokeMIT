abstract: The synthesis and characterization of the air-stable nickel(II)
  complex trans-(PCy2Ph)2Ni(o-tolyl)Cl is described in conjunction with an
  investigation of its use for the Mizorokiâ€“Heck-type, room temperature,
  internally selective coupling of substituted benzyl chlorides with terminal
  alkenes. This reaction, which employs a terminal alkene as an alkenylmetal
  equivalent, provides rapid, convergent access to substituted allylbenzene
  derivatives in high yield and with regioselectivity greater than 95:5 in
  nearly all cases. The reaction is operationally simple, can be carried out on
  the benchtop with no purification or degassing of solvents or reagents, and
  requires no exclusion of air or water during setup. Synthesis of the
  precatalyst is accomplished through a straightforward procedure that employs
  inexpensive, commercially available reagents, requires no purification steps,
  and proceeds in high yield.

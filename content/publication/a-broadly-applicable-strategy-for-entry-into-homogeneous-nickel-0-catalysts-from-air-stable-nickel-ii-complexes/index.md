abstract: A series of air-stable nickel complexes of the form L2Ni(aryl) X (L =
  monodentate phosphine, X = Cl, Br) and LNi(aryl)X (L = bis-phosphine) have
  been synthesized and are presented as a library of precatalysts suitable for a
  wide variety of nickel-catalyzed transformations. These complexes are easily
  synthesized from low-cost NiCl2·6H2O or NiBr2· 3H2O and the desired ligand
  followed by addition of 1 equiv of Grignard reagent. A selection of these
  complexes were characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, and an
  analysis of their structural features is provided. A case study of their use
  as precatalysts for the nickel-catalyzed carbonyl-ene reaction is presented,
  showing superior reactivity in comparison to reactions using Ni(cod)2.
  Furthermore, as the precatalysts are all stable to air, no glovebox or
  inert-atmosphere techniques are required to make use of these complexes for
  nickel-catalyzed reactions.

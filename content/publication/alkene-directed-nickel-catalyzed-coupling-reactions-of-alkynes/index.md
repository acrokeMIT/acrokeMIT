abstract: In alkene-directed, nickel-catalyzed coupling reactions of 1,3-enynes
  with aldehydes and epoxides, the conjugated alkene dramatically enhances
  reactivity and uniformly directs regioselectivity, independent of the nature
  of the other alkyne substituent (aryl, alkyl (1°, 2°, 3°)) or the degree of
  alkene substitution (mono-, di-, tri-, and tetrasubstituted). These
  observations are best explained by a temporary interaction between the alkene
  and the transition metal center during the regioselectivity-determining step.
  The highly substituted 1,3-diene products are useful in organic synthesis and,
  in conjunction with a Rh-catalyzed, site-selective hydrogenation, afford
  allylic and homoallylic alcohols that previously could not be prepared in high
  regioselectivity (or at all) with related Ni-catalyzed alkyne coupling
  reactions.

abstract: "Reversed selectivity: 1,3-Dioxan-5-ol templated epoxy alcohols
  undergo a remarkably selective cyclization, which occurs with near complete
  endo selectivity that is opposite to that predicted by Baldwin's rules. This
  endo preference in water near pH 7.0 is an order of magnitude larger relative
  to that of a previously disclosed THP-templated cyclization (see scheme),
  suggesting that “templates” may be important in the biosynthesis of marine
  ladder polyethers."

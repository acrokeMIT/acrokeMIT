summary: "Among the numerous approaches and reagents employed for electrophilic amination, nitrenoids have long stayed out of the limelight. Here, we systematically review the discovery, structural features and chemical reactivity of these promising reagents. We highlight advances in applying the chemistry of nitrenoids as well as outline current limitations and future directions."

  Among the numerous approaches and reagents employed for electrophilic amination, nitrenoids have long stayed out of the limelight. Here, we systematically review the discovery, structural features and chemical reactivity of these promising reagents. We highlight advances in applying the chemistry of nitrenoids as well as outline current limitations and future directions.

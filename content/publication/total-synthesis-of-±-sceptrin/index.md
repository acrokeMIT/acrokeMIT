abstract: A four-step synthesis of the dimeric pyrrole–imidazole alkaloid
  sceptrin is reported. The brevity of the route is based on a simple solution
  developed for selective assembly of the cyclobutane core of the natural
  product. The photochemical intermolecular [2 + 2] dimerization of a useful
  hymenidin surrogate enables direct entry to this enigmatic class of
  biologically active marine secondary metabolites.

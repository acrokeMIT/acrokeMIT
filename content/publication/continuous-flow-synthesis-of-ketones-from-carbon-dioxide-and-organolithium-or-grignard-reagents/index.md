summary: "We describe an efficient continuous flow synthesis of ketones from CO2
  and organolithium or Grignard reagents that exhibits significant advantages
  over conventional batch conditions in suppressing undesired symmetric ketone
  and tertiary alcohol byproducts. We observed an unprecedented
  solvent-dependence of the organolithium reactivity, the key factor in
  governing selectivity during the flow process. A facile, telescoped
  three-step–one-flow process for the preparation of ketones in a modular
  fashion through the in-line generation of organometallic reagents is also
  established."

abstract: Nitrosamines make up a major class of contaminants of emerging concern
  that are toxic, present at trace levels in aqueous environments, and
  challenging to destroy because of their chemical stability. We report novel
  redox electrodes based on hemin-functionalized carbon nanotubes showing high
  electrocatalytic activity for nitrosamine reduction at low potentials (−0.5 V
  vs Ag/AgCl or −0.27 vs the standard hydrogen electrode) and with turnover
  numbers of >700. The redox electrodes were tested under a range of electrolyte
  and pH conditions and demonstrated high conversion of nitrosamines at high
  reaction rates, even at parts per billion levels in secondary effluent from a
  wastewater treatment plant. We propose that the pathway for nitrosamine
  reduction involves a proton-mediated conversion of the nitroso group to
  hydrazines and secondary amines. These high-performance biomimetic
  electrocatalysts for nitrosamine reduction are based on complexes containing
  earth-abundant metals and, potentially, have broad applications in
  environmental remediation, water treatment, and industrial
  organo-electrochemical processes.

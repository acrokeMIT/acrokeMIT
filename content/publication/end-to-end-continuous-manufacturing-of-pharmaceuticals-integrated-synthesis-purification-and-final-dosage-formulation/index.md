summary: "A series of tubes: The continuous manufacture of a finished drug
  product starting from chemical intermediates is reported. The continuous
  pilot-scale plant used a novel route that incorporated many advantages of
  continuous-flow processes to produce active pharmaceutical ingredients and the
  drug product in one integrated system."

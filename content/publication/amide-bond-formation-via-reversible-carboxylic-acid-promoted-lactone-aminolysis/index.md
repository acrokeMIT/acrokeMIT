summary: "A rapid carboxylic acid-promoted lactone aminolysis is reported. A
  number of carboxylic acids were found to promote this amide bond-forming
  transformation, with aliphatic acids being the most efficient. This reaction
  is an equilibrium process (Keq ≈ 1.8), and mechanistic investigations are
  consistent with mediation of a kinetically important proton-transfer step by
  the carboxylate, i.e., the conjugate base of the acid employed."

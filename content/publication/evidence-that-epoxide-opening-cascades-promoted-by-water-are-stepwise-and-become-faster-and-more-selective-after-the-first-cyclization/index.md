summary: "A detailed kinetic study of the endo-selective epoxide-opening cascade
  reaction of a diepoxy alcohol in neutral water was undertaken using 1H NMR
  spectroscopy. The observation of monoepoxide intermediates resulting from
  initial endo and exo cyclization indicated that the cascade proceeds via a
  stepwise mechanism rather than through a concerted one. Independent synthesis
  and cyclization of these monoepoxide intermediates demonstrated that they are
  chemically and kinetically competent intermediates in the cascade. Analysis of
  each step of the reaction revealed that both the rate and regioselectivity of
  cyclization improve as the cascade reaction proceeds. In the second step,
  cyclization of an epoxy alcohol substrate templated by a fused diad of two
  tetrahydropyran rings proceeds with exceptionally high regioselectivity
  (endo:exo = 19:1), the highest we have measured in the opening of a simple
  trans-disubstituted epoxide. The origins of these observations are discussed."

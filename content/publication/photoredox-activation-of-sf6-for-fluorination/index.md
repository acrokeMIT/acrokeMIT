abstract: "We report the first practical use of SF6 as a fluorinating reagent in
  organic synthesis. Photoredox catalysis enables the inâ€…situ conversion of SF6,
  an inert gas, into an active fluorinating species by using visible light.
  Under these conditions, deoxyfluorination of allylic alcohols is effected with
  high chemoselectivity and is tolerant of a wide range of functional groups.
  Application of the methodology in a continuous-flow setup achieves comparable
  yields to those obtained with a batch setup, while providing drastically
  increased material throughput of valuable allylic fluoride products. "

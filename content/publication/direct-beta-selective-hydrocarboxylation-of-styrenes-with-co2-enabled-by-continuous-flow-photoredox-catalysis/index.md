  The direct β-selective hydrocarboxylation

  of styrenes under atmospheric pressure of CO2 has been

  developed using photoredox catalysis in continuous flow.

  The scope of this methodology was demonstrated with a

  range of functionalized terminal styrenes, as well as αsubstituted and β-substituted styrenes.

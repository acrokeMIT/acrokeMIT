abstract: Technological advances have an important role in the design of greener
  synthetic processes. In this Personal Account, we describe a wide range of
  thermal, photochemical, catalytic, and biphasic chemical transformations
  examined by our group. Each of these demonstrate how the merits of a
  continuous flow synthesis platform can align with some of the goals put forth
  by the Twelve Principles of Green Chemistry. In particular, we illustrate the
  potential for improved reaction efficiency in terms of atom economy, product
  yield and reaction rates, the ability to design synthetic process with
  chemical and solvent waste reduction in mind as well as highlight the benefits
  of the real-time monitoring capabilities in flow for highly controlled
  synthetic output.

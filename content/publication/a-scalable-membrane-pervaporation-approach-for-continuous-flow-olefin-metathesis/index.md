abstract: The translation of olefin metathesis reactions from the laboratory to
  process scale has been challenging with traditional batch techniques. In this
  contribution, we describe a continuous membrane reactor design that
  selectively permeates the ethylene byproduct from metathetical processes,
  thereby overcoming the mass-transport limitations that have negatively
  influenced the efficiency of this transformation in batch vessels. The
  membrane sheet-in-frame pervaporation module yielded turnover numbers of >7500
  in the case of diethyl diallylmalonate ring-closing metathesis. The
  preparation of more challenging, low-effective-molarity substrates, a
  cyclooctene and a 14-membered macrocyclic lactone, was also effective. A
  comparison of optimal membrane reactor conditions to a sealed tubular reactor
  revealed that the benefits of ethylene removal are most apparent at low
  reaction concentrations.

  Herein, we report the first ligand-controlled, nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling
  of aliphatic N-tosylaziridines

  with aliphatic organozinc reagents. The reaction protocol displays complete regioselectivity for reaction at the less hindered Câˆ’N bond, and the products are furnished in good to excellent yield for a broad selection of substrates. Moreover, we have developed an air-stable nickel(II) chloride/ligand precatalyst that can be handled and stored outside a glovebox. In addition to increasing the activity of this catalyst system, this also greatly improves the practicality of this reaction, as the use of the very air-sensitive Ni(cod)2 is avoided. Finally, mechanistic investigations, including deuterium-labeling studies, show that the reaction proceeds with overall inversion of configuration at the terminal position of the aziridine by way of aziridine ring opening by Ni (inversion), transmetalation (retention), and reductive elimination (retention)

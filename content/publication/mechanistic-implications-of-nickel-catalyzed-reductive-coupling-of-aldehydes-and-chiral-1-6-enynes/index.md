abstract: A study of nickel-catalyzed reductive coupling reactions of aldehydes
  and chiral 1,6-enynes has provided evidence for three distinct mechanistic
  pathways that govern regioselectivity in this transformation. In the absence
  of a phosphine additive, high regioselectivity and high diastereoselectivity
  are obtained as a direct result of coordination of both the alkyne and the
  olefin to the metal center during the Câˆ’C bond-forming step.

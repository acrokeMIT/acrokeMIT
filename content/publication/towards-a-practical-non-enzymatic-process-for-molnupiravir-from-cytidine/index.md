abstract: A scalable four step synthesis of molnupiravir from cytidine is
  described herein. The attractiveness of this approach is its fully chemical
  nature involving inexpensive reagents and more environmentally friendly
  solvents such as water, isopropanol, acetonitrile and acetone. Isolation and
  purification procedures are improved in comparison to our earlier report, as
  all intermediates can be isolated via aqueous acid treatment and
  recrystallization. The key steps in the synthesis, namely ester formation,
  hydroxamination and deprotection were done on multigram scale to afford
  molnupiravir in 36-41% yield with average purity of 98 wt% by q-NMR and 99
  area % by HPLC

abstract: Highly substituted, very hindered enones were synthesized using a
  two-step procedure that utilizes a diiodosamarium-promoted Reformatsky-type
  coupling and dehydration using Martin sulfurane. Both α-chloro- and
  α-bromoketones were coupled with a variety of carbonyl nucleophiles to form
  the intermediate β-hydroxyketones, occurring with excellent
  diastereoselectivity, favoring the syn isomer (R1 = Me). This technique
  complements other methods and enables the preparation of enones outside of the
  scope of current olefination methodology.

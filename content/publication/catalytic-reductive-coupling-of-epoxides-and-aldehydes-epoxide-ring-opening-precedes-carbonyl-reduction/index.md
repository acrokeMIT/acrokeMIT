summary: "Several lines of evidence suggest that reduction of the carbonyl group
  occurs after epoxide-ring opening in the first examples of catalytic,
  reductive coupling of epoxides and aldehydes (see scheme). The hydroxyether
  products are obtained with >95:5 regioselectivity in all cases, independent of
  the steric and electronic nature of R1 and R2."

The hydroxyether products are obtained with >95:5 regioselectivity in all cases, independent of the steric and electronic nature of R1 and R2.

abstract: Continuous flow reactors are enabling tools that can significantly
  benefit chemical reactions, especially those that are path length dependent
  (e.g., photochemical), mixing or transport dependent (e.g., gas-liquid),
  exothermic, or utilize hazardous or unstable intermediates. In this review, it
  is demonstrated how the nearly instantaneous mixing, exceptionally fast mass
  transfer, safe access to high temperatures and pressures, and high surface
  area to volume ratio can be leveraged to improve product yield, reaction rates
  and/or selectivity. By showcasing five synthetic methodologies examined by our
  group, it is hoped that the reader will gain an appreciation of the accessible
  and transformative nature of flow chemistry for improving existing
  transformations, enabling rapid optimization, and for developing new
  methodologies that depend on precise parameter controls.

summary: "Skipped polyenes featuring high (E)-selectivity and varying methyl
  substitution patterns are synthesized using a nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling
  reaction between allyl trifluoroacetates and vinyl bromides. The utility of
  this cross-electrophile coupling is showcased in part by the synthesis of the
  RST fragment of the marine ladder polyether, maitotoxin. Construction of this
  fragment is particularly challenging due to the alternating methyl
  substitution pattern."

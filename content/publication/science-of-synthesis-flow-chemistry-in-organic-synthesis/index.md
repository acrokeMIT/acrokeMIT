summary: "An emerging and strengthening trend is that flow chemistry is much more than the adaption of batch processes to flow systems. Rather, flow chemistry offers a new paradigm in the way we think about chemical synthesis. This volume demonstrates the enabling power of continuous flow to access new reaction types and different chemistry space and, to this end, it has been compiled by a team of pioneers and leaders, who present both the practical and conceptual aspects of this rapidly growing field. Included are the principles of reactor design, automation, and separations/purifications in flow systems, applications in photochemistry, electrochemistry, gaseous systems, immobilized reagents and catalysts, and multistep processes. The synthesis of peptides, carbohydrates, and pharmaceuticals is covered and several chapters give insight into the use of flow in an industrial context."

summary: Recent advances using nickel complexes in the activation of
  unactivated monosubstituted olefins for catalytic intermolecular carbon-carbon
  bond-forming reactions with carbonyl compounds, such as simple aldehydes,
  isocyanates, and conjugated aldehydes and ketones, are discussed. In these
  reactions, the olefins function as vinyl- and allylmetal equivalents,
  providing a new strategy for organic synthesis. Current limitations and the
  outlook for this new strategy are also discussed.

abstract: Nickel-catalyzed reductive coupling reactions of 1,3-enynes and
  aromatic aldehydes efficiently afford conjugated dienols in excellent
  regioselectivity and modest enantioselectivity when conducted in the presence
  of catalytic amounts of a monodentate, P-chiral ferrocenyl phosphine ligand.
  1-(Trimethylsilyl)-substituted enynes are shown to be effective coupling
  partners in these reactions, and the dienol products thus formed readily
  undergo protiodesilylation under mild conditions.

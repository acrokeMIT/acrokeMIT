abstract: A continuous protocol for the two-carbon homologation of esters to
  α,β-unsaturated esters is described. This multireactor homologation telescopes
  an ester reduction, phosphonate deprotonation, and Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons
  olefination, thus converting a three-operation procedure into a single,
  uninterrupted system that eliminates the need for isolation or purification of
  the aldehyde intermediates. The homologated products are obtained in high
  yield and selectivity.

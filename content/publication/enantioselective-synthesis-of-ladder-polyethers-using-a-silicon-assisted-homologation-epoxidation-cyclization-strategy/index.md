abstract: A trimethylsilyl (SiMe3) group is the basis of a strategy that
  emulates the three fundamental proposed processes in ladder polyether
  biosynthesis:  chain homologation, stereoselective epoxidation (>95% ee or
  >95:5 dr), and endo-selective, stereospecific (inversion) hydroxyepoxide
  cyclization (>95:5 endo:exo, >95% dr). A tris-THP was synthesized in 18 total
  operations from commercial materials using this approach.

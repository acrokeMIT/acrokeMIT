summary: "A highly enantioselective method for catalytic reductive coupling of
  alkynes and aldehydes is described. Allylic alcohols are afforded with
  complete E/Z selectivity, generally >95:5 regioselectivity, and in up to 96%
  ee. In conjunction with ozonolysis, this process is complementary to existing
  methods of enantioselective α-hydroxy ketone synthesis."

summary: "The development and operation of the synthesis and workup steps of a
  fully integrated, continuous manufacturing plant for synthesizing aliskiren, a
  small molecule pharmaceutical, are presented. The plant started with advanced
  intermediates, two synthetic steps away from the final active pharmaceutical
  ingredient, and ended with finished tablets. The entire process was run on
  several occasions, with the data presented herein corresponding to a 240 h run
  at a nominal throughput of 41 g h−1 of aliskiren. The first reaction was
  performed solvent-free in a molten condition at a high temperature, achieving
  high yields (90%) and avoiding solid handling and a long residence time (due
  to higher concentrations compared to dilute conditions when run at lower
  temperatures in a solvent). The resulting stream was worked-up inline using
  liquid−liquid extraction with membrane-based separators that were scaled-up
  from microfluidic designs. The second reaction involved a Boc deprotection,
  using aqueous HCl that was rapidly quenched with aqueous NaOH using an inline
  pH measurement to control NaOH addition. The reaction maintained high yields
  (90−95%) under closed-loop control despite process disturbances."

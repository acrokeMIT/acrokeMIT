abstract: "Give and take: Both a strong electron donor (1) and a strong electron
  acceptor (P(OPh)3) are necessary for a highly selective, nickel-catalyzed
  coupling reaction between alkenes, aldehydes, and silyl triflates (see scheme;
  cod=cycloocta-1,5-diene, Tf=trifluoromethanesulfonyl). This synergistic effect
  may also be useful in other transformations catalyzed by NHC–metal complexes
  (NHC=N-heterocyclic carbene)."

abstract: Carbon dioxide (CO2) is an attractive building block for organic
  synthesis that is environmentally friendly. Continuous flow technologies have
  enabled C−O and C−C bond forming reactions with CO2 that previously were
  either low-yielding or impossible in batch to afford value-added chemicals.
  This review describes recent advances in continuous flow as an enabling
  strategy in utilizing CO2 as a C1 building block in chemical synthesis.

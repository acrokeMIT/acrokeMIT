summary: "A nickel-catalyzed method for the three-component coupling of alkenes(ethylene and alpha olefins), aldehydes, and silyl triflates is described, and this process represents the first catalytic method for coupling aldehydes and alkenes to give allylic alcohol derivatives. Conceptually, the alkene functions as a replacement for an alkenylmetal reagent."

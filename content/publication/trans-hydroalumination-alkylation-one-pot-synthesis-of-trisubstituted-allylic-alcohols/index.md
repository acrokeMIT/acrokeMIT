abstract: Described herein is a method of stereoselective synthesis of
  trisubstituted allylic alcohols by alkylation of alkenyl alanates, formed in
  situ through treatment of propargyl alcohols with Vitride (Red-Al). This
  technique represents the first of its kind to feature a trans-hydrometalation,
  and is particularly effective for the formation of 1,4-dienes. Applications
  involving primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols are discussed, as well as
  limitations regarding both alkyne and electrophile components.

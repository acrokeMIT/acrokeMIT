abstract: A modular continuous flow synthesis of imatinib and analogues is
  reported. Structurally diverse imatinib analogues are rapidly generated using
  three readily available building blocks via a flow hydration/chemoselective
  Câ€“N coupling sequence. The newly developed continuous flow hydration and
  amidation modules each exhibit a broad scope with good to excellent yields.
  Overall, the method described does not require solvent switches, in-line
  purifications, or packed-bed apparatuses due to the judicious manipulation of
  flow setups and solvent mixtures.

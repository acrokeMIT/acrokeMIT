abstract: Nickel-catalyzed, intramolecular and intermolecular reductive coupling
  of alkynes and epoxides affords synthetically useful homoallylic alcohols of
  defined alkene geometry. Very high regioselectivity is generally observed, and
  cyclizations proceed with complete selectivity for endo epoxide opening. This
  catalytic reaction represents the first use of a non-Ï€-based electrophile in a
  growing class of nickel-catalyzed, multicomponent coupling reactions, and is
  the first catalytic method of reductive coupling of alkynes and epoxides that
  is effective for both intermolecular and intramolecular cases, and
  mechanistically distinct from these, possibly involving a nickella(II)oxetane.

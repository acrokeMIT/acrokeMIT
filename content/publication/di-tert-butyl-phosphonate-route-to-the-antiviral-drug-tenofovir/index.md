summary: "Di-tert-butyl oxymethyl phosphonates were investigated regarding their
  suitability for preparing the active pharmaceutical ingredient tenofovir
  (PMPA). First, an efficient and simple access to the crystalline
  di-tert-butyl(hydroxymethyl)phosphonate was developed. O-Mesylation gave high
  yields of the active phosphonomethylation reagent. For the synthesis of
  tenofovir, a two-step sequence was developed using Mg(OtBu)2 as the base for
  the alkylation of (R)-9-(2-hydroxypropyl)adenine. Subsequent deprotection
  could be achieved with aqueous acids. (Di-tert-butoxyphosphoryl)methyl
  methanesulfonate showed to be the most efficient electrophile tested,
  affording PMPA in 72% yield on a 5 g scale. The developed protocol could also
  be applied for the preparation of the hepatitis B drug adefovir (64% yield/1 g
  scale)"

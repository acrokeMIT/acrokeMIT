summary: "A rapid and modular continuous flow synthesis of highly functionalized
  fluorinated pyrazoles and pyrazolines has been developed. Flowing fluorinated
  amines through sequential reactor coils mediates diazoalkane formation and
  [3+2] cycloaddition to generate more than 30 azoles in a telescoped fashion.
  Pyrazole cores are then sequentially modified through additional reactor
  modules performing N-alkylation and arylation, deprotection, and amidation to
  install broad molecular diversity in short order. Continuous flow synthesis
  enables the safe handling of diazoalkanes at elevated temperatures, and the
  use of aryl alkyne dipolarphiles under catalyst-free conditions. This
  assembly-line synthesis provides a flexible approach for the synthesis of
  agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals, as demonstrated by a four-step, telescoped
  synthesis of measles therapeutic, AS-136A, in a total residence time of
  31.7 min (1.76 g h−1)."

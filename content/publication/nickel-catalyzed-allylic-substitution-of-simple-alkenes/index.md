abstract: This report describes a nickel-catalyzed allylic substitution process
  of simple alkenes whereby an important structural motif, a 1,4-diene, was
  prepared. The key to success is the use of an appropriate nickelâ€“phosphine
  complex and a stoichiometric amount of silyl triflate. Reactions of
  1-alkyl-substituted alkenes consistently provided 1,1-disubstituted alkenes
  with high selectivity. Insight into the reaction mechanism as well as
  miscellaneous application of the developed catalytic process is also
  documented.

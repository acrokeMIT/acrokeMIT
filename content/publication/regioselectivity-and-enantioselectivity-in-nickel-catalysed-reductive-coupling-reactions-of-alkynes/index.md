abstract: Nickel-catalysed reductive coupling reactions of alkynes have emerged
  as powerful synthetic tools for the selective preparation of functionalized
  alkenes. One of the greatest challenges associated with these transformations
  is control of regioselectivity. Recent work from our laboratory has provided
  an improved understanding of several of the factors governing regioselectivity
  in these reactions, and related studies have revealed that the reaction
  mechanism can differ substantially depending on the ligand employed. A
  discussion of stereoselective transformations and novel applications of nickel
  catalysis in coupling reactions of alkynes is also included.

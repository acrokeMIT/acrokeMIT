abstract: Synthetic studies on the antibiotic natural product ripostatin A have
  been carried out with the aim to construct the C9−C10 bond by a
  nickel(0)-catalyzed coupling reaction of an enyne and an epoxide, followed by
  rearrangement of the resulting dienylcyclopropane intermediate to afford the
  skipped 1,4,7-triene. A cyclopropyl enyne fragment corresponding to C1−C9 has
  been synthesized in high yield and demonstrated to be a competent substrate
  for the nickel(0)-catalyzed coupling with a model epoxide. Several synthetic
  approaches toward the C10−C26 epoxide have been pursued. The C13 stereocenter
  can be set by allylation and reductive decyanation of a cyanohydrin acetonide.
  A mild, fluoride-promoted decarboxylation enables construction of the C15−C16
  bond by an aldol reaction. The product of this transformation is of the
  correct oxidation state and potentially three steps removed from the targeted
  epoxide fragment.

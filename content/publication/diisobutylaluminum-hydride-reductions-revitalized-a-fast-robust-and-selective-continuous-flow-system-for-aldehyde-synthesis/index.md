summary: "A continuous flow system for the multiparameter (flow rate,
  temperature, residence time, stoichiometry) optimization of the DIBALH
  reduction of esters to aldehydes is described. Incorporating an in-line quench
  (MeOH), these transformations are generally complete in fewer than 60 s.
  Mixing of the DIBALH and ester solutions was observed to be an exceptionally
  critical parameter for optimum results. This system thus provides general
  guidelines based on the structure of the ester for selective reduction of an
  ester without overreduction."

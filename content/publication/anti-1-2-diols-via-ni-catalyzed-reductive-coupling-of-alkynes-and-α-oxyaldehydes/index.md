abstract: Ni-catalyzed reductive coupling of aryl alkynes (1) and
  enantiomerically enriched α-oxyaldehydes (2) afford differentiated
  anti-1,2-diols (3) with high diastereoselectivity and regioselectivity,
  despite the fact that the methoxymethyl (MOM) and para-methoxybenzyl (PMB)
  protective groups typically favor syn-1,2-diol formation in carbonyl addition
  reactions of this family of aldehydes.

summary: "The use of strong organometallic bases and nucleophiles is commonplace
  in modern organic synthesis. That they react with a wide range of functional
  groups requires accurate and precise stoichiometry in reactions that utilize
  them. For best results, these bases are titrated prior to use, and such
  titrations can be time-consuming and variable due to human error near the end
  point. Herein, we describe an automated method for titrations of multiple
  commercial organometallic reagents enabled by continuous flow. Through
  utilizations of continuous monitoring via UV–vis spectroscopy and a feedback
  loop developed within LabVIEW, titrations with enhanced reproducibility were
  provided over current batch procedures"

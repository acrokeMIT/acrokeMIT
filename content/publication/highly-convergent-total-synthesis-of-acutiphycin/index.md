sumamry: "An enantioselective, convergent, total synthesis of (+)-acutiphycin
  (18 steps, longest linear sequence from commercial materials) features the
  first application of an alkynyl ether as a macrolactone precursor in total
  synthesis, as well as the first example of an intermolecular, SmI2-mediated,
  Reformatsky fragment coupling reaction. The high convergence, efficiency, and
  modular nature of this synthesis make it amenable to the synthesis of
  structurally related compounds."

abstract: "Nucleosides in flow: A general, scalable method of Brønsted
  acid-catalyzed nucleoside formation is described. Because of the high reaction
  temperatures readily available to the flow reaction format, mild Brønsted
  acids, particularly pyridinium triflates, can be used. A one-flow multistep
  synthesis of unprotected nucleosides is also reported (see scheme)."

abstract: (−)-Terpestacin (1a, naturally occurring enantiomer) and
  (+)-11-epi-terpestacin (1b) were prepared using catalyst-controlled,
  stereoselective intermolecular reductive couplings of alkyne 4 and aldehyde 5.
  Related to enantioselective methods developed in our laboratory, these
  stereoselective fragment couplings were instrumental in confirming that
  “siccanol” is not 11-epi-terpestacin, but in fact is (−)-terpestacin itself.

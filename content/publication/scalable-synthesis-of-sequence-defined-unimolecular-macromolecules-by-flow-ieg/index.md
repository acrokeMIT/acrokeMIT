abstract: We report a semiautomated synthesis of sequence and architecturally
  defined, unimolecular macromolecules through a marriage of multistep flow
  synthesis and iterative exponential growth (Flow-IEG). The Flow-IEG system
  performs three reactions and an in-line purification in a total residence time
  of under 10 min, effectively doubling the molecular weight of an oligomeric
  species in an uninterrupted reaction sequence. Further iterations using the
  Flow-IEG system enable an exponential increase in molecular weight.
  Incorporating a variety of monomer structures and branching units provides
  control over polymer sequence and architecture. The synthesis of a uniform
  macromolecule with a molecular weight of 4,023 g/mol is demonstrated. The
  user-friendly nature, scalability, and modularity of Flow-IEG provide a
  general strategy for the automated synthesis of sequence defined, unimolecular
  macromolecules. Flow-IEG is thus an enabling tool for theory validation,
  structureâ€“property studies, and advanced applications in biotechnology and
  materials science.

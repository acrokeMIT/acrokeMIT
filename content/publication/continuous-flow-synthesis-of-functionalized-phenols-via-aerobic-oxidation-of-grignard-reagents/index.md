abstract: Phenols are important compounds in chemical industry. An economical
  and green approach to phenol preparation by the direct oxidation of aryl
  Grignard reagents using compressed air in continuous gas-liquid segmented flow
  systems is described. The process tolerates a broad range of functional
  groups, including oxidation-sensitive functionalities such as alkenes, amines,
  and thioethers. By integrating a benzyne-mediated in-line generation of
  arylmagnesium intermediates with the aerobic oxidation, a facile three-step,
  one-flow process, capable of preparing 2-functionalized phenols in a modular
  fashion, is established.

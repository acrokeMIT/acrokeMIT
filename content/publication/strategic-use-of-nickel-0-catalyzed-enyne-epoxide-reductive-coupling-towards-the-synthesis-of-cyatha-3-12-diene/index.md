abstract: Various situations are explored in which the nickel(0)-catalyzed
  enyne–epoxide reductive coupling was utilized to access key intermediates
  toward the total synthesis of (−)-cyatha-3,12-diene (1). Enantioenriched
  3,5-dien-1-ols with a variety of functionality were obtained in a
  straightforward manner from easily accessible 1,3-enynes and terminal
  epoxides.

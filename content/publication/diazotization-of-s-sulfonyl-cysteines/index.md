summary: "We report the preparation of enantiomerically enriched
  β-thio-α-hydroxy and α-chloro carboxylic acid and ester building blocks by
  diazotization of S-sulfonyl-cysteines. The thiosulfonate protecting group
  demonstrated resistance to oxidation and attenuation of sulfur’s
  nucleophilicity by the anomeric effect. The key transformation was optimized
  by a 22 factorial design of experiment, highlighting the unique reactivity of
  cysteine derivatives in comparison with aliphatic amino acids."

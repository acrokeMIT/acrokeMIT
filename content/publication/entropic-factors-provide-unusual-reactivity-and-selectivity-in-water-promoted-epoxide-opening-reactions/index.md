abstract: Despite the myriad of selective enzymatic reactions that occur in
  water, chemists have rarely capitalized on the unique properties of this
  medium to govern selectivity in reactions. Here we report detailed mechanistic
  investigations of a water-promoted reaction that displays high selectivity for
  what is generally a disfavored product. A combination of structural and
  kinetic data indicates not only that synergy between substrate and water
  suppresses undesired pathways but also that water promotes the desired pathway
  by stabilizing charge in the transition state, facilitating proton transfer,
  doubly activating the substrate for reaction, and perhaps most remarkably,
  reorganizing the substrate into a reactive conformation that leads to the
  observed product. This approach serves as an outline for a general strategy of
  exploiting solvent-solute interactions to achieve unusual reactivity in
  chemical reactions. These findings may also have implications in the
  biosynthesis of the ladder polyether natural products, such as the brevetoxins
  and ciguatoxins.

abstract: Chemists have long sought sequence-controlled synthetic polymers that
  mimic nature's biopolymers, but a practical synthetic route that enables
  absolute control over polymer sequence and structure remains a key challenge.
  Here, we report an iterative exponential growth plus side-chain
  functionalization (IEG+) strategy that begins with enantiopure epoxides and
  facilitates the efficient synthesis of a family of uniform >3 kDa
  macromolecules of varying sequence and stereoconfiguration that are coupled to
  produce unimolecular polymers (>6 kDa) with sequences and structures that
  cannot be obtained using traditional polymerization techniques. Selective
  side-chain deprotection of three hexadecamers is also demonstrated, which
  imbues each compound with the ability to dissolve in water. We anticipate that
  these new macromolecules and the general IEG+ strategy will find broad
  application as a versatile platform for the scalable synthesis of
  sequence-controlled polymers.

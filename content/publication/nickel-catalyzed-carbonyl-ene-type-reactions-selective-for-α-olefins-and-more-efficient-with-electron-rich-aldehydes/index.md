abstract: Described are several classes of unusual or unprecedented
  carbonyl-ene-type reactions, including those between alpha olefins and
  aromatic aldehydes. Catalyzed by nickel, these processes complement existing
  Lewis acid-catalyzed methods in several respects. Not only are monosubstituted
  alkenes, aromatic aldehydes, and tert-alkyl aldehydes effective substrates,
  but monosubstituted olefins also react faster than those that are more
  substituted, and large or electron-rich aldehydes are more effective than
  small or electron-poor ones. Conceptually, in the presence of a
  nickel−phosphine catalyst, the combination of off-the-shelf alkenes, silyl
  triflates, and triethylamine functions as a replacement for an allylmetal
  reagent.

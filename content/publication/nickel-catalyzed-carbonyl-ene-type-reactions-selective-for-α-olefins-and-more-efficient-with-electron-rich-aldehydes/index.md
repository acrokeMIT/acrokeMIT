summary: "Described are several classes of unusual or unprecedented carbonyl-ene-type reactions, including those between alpha olefins and aromatic aldehydes. Catalyzed by nickel, these processes complement existing Lewis acid-catalyzed methods in several respects. Not only are monosubstituted alkenes, aromatic aldehydes, and tert-alkyl aldehydes effective substrates, but monosubstituted olefins also react faster than those that are more substituted, and large or electron-rich aldehydes are more effective than small or electron-poor ones. Conceptually, in the presence of a nickel−phosphine catalyst, the combination of off-the-shelf alkenes, silyl triflates, and triethylamine functions as a replacement for an allylmetal reagent."

abstract: Synthetic studies toward the total synthesis of (+)-acutiphycin (1)
  resulted in the discovery of additive-free, highly regioselective
  nickel-catalyzed reductive coupling reactions of aldehydes and 1,6-enynes and
  the construction of an advanced intermediate in studies directed toward the
  synthesis of 1. Ultimately, although not employing the nickel-catalyzed
  reaction, a highly convergent total synthesis of (+)-acutiphycin featuring an
  intermolecular SmI2-mediated Reformatsky coupling reaction and
  macrolactonization initiated by a retro-ene reaction of an alkoxyalkyne was
  achieved. The resulting synthesis was 18 steps in the longest linear sequence
  from either methyl acetoacetate or isobutyraldehyde.

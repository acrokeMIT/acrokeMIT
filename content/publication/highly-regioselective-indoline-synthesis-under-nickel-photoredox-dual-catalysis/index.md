abstract: Nickel/photoredox catalysis is used to synthesize indolines in one
  step from iodoacetanilides and alkenes. Very high regioselectivity for
  3-substituted indoline products is obtained for both aliphatic and styrenyl
  olefins. Mechanistic investigations indicate that oxidation to Ni(III) is
  necessary to perform the difficult Câˆ’N bond-forming reductive elimination,
  producing a Ni(I) complex, which in turn is reduced to Ni(0). This process
  serves to further demonstrate the utility of photoredox catalysts as
  controlled single electron transfer agents in multioxidation state nickel
  catalysis

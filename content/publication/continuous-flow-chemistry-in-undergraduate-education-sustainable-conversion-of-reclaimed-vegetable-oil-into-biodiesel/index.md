summary: "This laboratory experiment leverages the pedagogical value and
  multidisciplinary nature of biodiesel production from vegetable oil to
  introduce students to continuous-flow chemistry, a modern and rapidly growing
  approach to chemical synthesis. An interdisciplinary approach exposes students
  to the practical and conceptual aspects of modern continuous-flow chemistry
  while simultaneously reinforcing core organic chemistry techniques and
  investing students in issues of sustainability. Students screen reaction
  conditions in flow through an inquiry guided approach and make evidence-based
  decisions to accomplish the sustainable conversion of waste cooking oil into
  biofuel. The laboratory experiment is designed to be highly modular and can be
  completed in two, three, five, or eight laboratory periods. By incorporating
  the burgeoning field of continuous-flow chemistry into the educational
  infrastructure, the experiments allow students to develop skills that are
  highly valued in the modern chemical workforce."

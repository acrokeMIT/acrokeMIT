abstract: Herein, we demonstrate the on-demand synthesis of chloramine from
  aqueous ammonia and sodium hypochlorite solutions, and its subsequent
  utilization as an ambiphilic nitrogen source in continuous-flow synthesis.
  Despite its advantages in cost and atom economy, chloramine has not seen
  widespread use in batch synthesis due to its unstable and hazardous nature.
  Continuous-flow chemistry, however, provides an excellent platform for
  generating and handling chloramine in a safe, reliable, and inexpensive
  manner. Unsaturated aldehydes are converted to valuable aziridines and
  nitriles, and thioethers are converted to sulfoxides, in moderate to good
  yields and exceedingly short reaction times. In this telescoped process,
  chloramine is generated in situ and immediately used, providing safe and
  efficient conditions for reaction scale-up while mitigating the issue of its
  decomposition over time.
